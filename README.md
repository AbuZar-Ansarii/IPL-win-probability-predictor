# 🏏 IPL Win Probability Predictor

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **IPL Win Probability Predictor** that uses machine learning to predict the chances of a team winning a match based on real-time match statistics. It takes inputs such as runs, wickets, overs, and required run rate to estimate the probability of a team winning.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts win probability based on match conditions  
- Uses machine learning to analyze past IPL match data  
- Simple web-based interface for easy access  
- Real-time updates for dynamic probability estimation  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Core logic & ML model)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data processing)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning model)  
- **Flask/Streamlit** (Web application)  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Data visualization)
